            "\n",
            "2. Reduced muscle soreness: Foam rolling can help to alleviate muscle soreness and stiffness by increasing blood flow to the muscles and promoting faster recovery.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Enhanced recovery: Foam rolling can help to speed up the recovery process after a workout by reducing inflammation and promoting muscle relaxation.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Injury prevention: Regular foam rolling can help to prevent injuries by improving muscle imbalances, reducing tension in muscles, and promoting proper movement patterns.\n",
